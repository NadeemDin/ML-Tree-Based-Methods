    "- Root Node : First condition or feature that we check/split (first point on tree).\n",
    "- Leaf (Terminal) Node : when root splits it leaves a leaf only if at that node, data isnt split.\n",
    "- Parent and Children Nodes : relationship between node splitting into leaf or more.\n",
    "- Tree Branches (Sub Trees) : where from the root, nodes split and then split again, creating multilevels of branching.\n",
    "- Pruning : in theory making decision tree shorter by shortening nodes by making more effective conditions to avoid overfitting for more biased tree model."
